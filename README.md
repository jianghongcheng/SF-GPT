## 📌 Introduction

Near-Infrared (NIR) imaging provides enhanced contrast and sensitivity but lacks the spatial and textural richness of RGB images. NIR-to-RGB translation is a challenging task due to:

- Spectral mapping ambiguity

  </p>

- Statistical weak correlation between NIR and RGB

We propose **SF-GPT**, a novel deep learning architecture that leverages both spatial and frequency domains through transformer-based mechanisms.

## ✨ Key Contributions

<ol>
  <li><strong>SF-GPT:</strong> We propose a novel Spatial-Frequency Guided Pixel Transformer for NIR-to-RGB translation, combining spatial and frequency cues to capture both local textures and global context.</li>

  <li><strong>Dual-domain Feature Extraction:</strong> We incorporate DCT or DWT to extract low- and high-frequency features, while pixel-wise cues are obtained via PixelUnshuffle for fine-grained reconstruction.</li>

  <li><strong>SFG-MSA Module:</strong> We design a Spatial-Frequency Guided Multi-head Self-Attention mechanism that adaptively fuses pixel and frequency features, enhancing translation fidelity and feature discrimination.</li>

  <li><strong>State-of-the-art Performance:</strong> Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of SF-GPT, outperforming existing methods in both visual quality and quantitative metrics.</li>
