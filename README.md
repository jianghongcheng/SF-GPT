## ðŸ“Œ Introduction

Near-Infrared (NIR) imaging provides enhanced contrast and sensitivity but lacks the spatial and textural richness of RGB images. NIR-to-RGB translation is a challenging task due to:

- Spectral mapping ambiguity  
- Statistical weak correlation between NIR and RGB

We propose **SF-GPT**, a novel deep learning architecture that leverages both spatial and frequency domains through transformer-based mechanisms.
