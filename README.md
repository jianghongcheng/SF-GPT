## ðŸ“Œ Introduction

Near-Infrared (NIR) imaging provides enhanced contrast and sensitivity but lacks the spatial and textural richness of RGB images. NIR-to-RGB translation is a challenging task due to:

- Spectral mapping ambiguity

  </p>

- Statistical weak correlation between NIR and RGB

We propose **SF-GPT**, a novel deep learning architecture that leverages both spatial and frequency domains through transformer-based mechanisms.

## âœ¨ Contributions

<ol>
  <li>We propose a Spatial-Frequency Guided Pixel Transformer (SF-GPT), a novel framework for NIR-to-RGB translation that effectively combines pixel and spatial-frequency features to capture both local textures and global context.</li>

  <li>Our method integrates Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) or Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) decomposition to extract spatial-frequency domain features. These transformations decompose input images into distinct low-frequency and high-frequency components, while pixel features are extracted using the PixelUnshuffle operation.</li>

  <li>We introduce Spatial-Frequency Guided Multi-head Self-Attention (SFG-MSA), a novel self-attention mechanism that enhances the network's ability to extract critical features from both pixel and spatial-frequency representations, improving overall feature discrimination and translation accuracy.</li>

  <li>We conduct extensive experiments demonstrating the superior performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods, showcasing the effectiveness of SF-GPT in accurately translating NIR images to RGB images.</li>
